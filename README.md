**ChatGPT-Based LLM Chatbot**
An AI-powered chatbot leveraging OpenAI's API, LangChain, and FAISS for intelligent document-based conversations.

This project builds a Conversational AI Assistant using LangChain, FAISS, OpenAIâ€™s API, and Streamlit. It allows users to upload documents, retrieve information using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and interact with the chatbot dynamically.

Features
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Retrieves relevant content from uploaded documents before answering.
- Vector Embeddings with FAISS: Efficiently searches documents using OpenAI embeddings.
- Memory Management: Uses ConversationBufferMemory & ConversationSummaryBufferMemory for tracking context.
- Streaming Responses: Supports real-time streaming of AI-generated answers.
- Interactive UI with Streamlit: Easy-to-use web app for uploading files and chatting.
- Wikipedia Retrieval: Enhances responses using Wikipedia as an external knowledge source.
